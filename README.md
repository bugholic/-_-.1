<h1>Calculator App</h1><br> 
This is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application also supports clearing the calculator display and deleting the last entered digit.
